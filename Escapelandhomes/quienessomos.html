            <div class="heroTitle" >How this idea comes true</div>
                <p>It was October 18, 2016, when a young Dutch designers world got turned upside down instantly. An article about the cabin he had designed for his mother received global attention following a publication in Dezeen, one of the worldâ€™s most popular design magazines. He had been playing with ways for people to live closer to nature for a long time, and then came his idea to let the world experience the beauty of nature in a safe and comfortable environment.</p>
                <p>Caspar Schols is the Dutch designer behind Cabin ANNA. After obtaining his BSc and a MSc in Physics from the University of Amsterdam in 2015, his mother asked him to build her a garden cabin. With a fascination for architecture and design but no architectural training, he was looking for a concept to create a dynamic connection between man, nature and home. A flexible space where his mum could read or paint, organise family dinners, somewhere her grandchildren could give theatre performances. But above all, the cabin had to bring her closer to nature. After completion, the cabin was called Garden House.</p>
